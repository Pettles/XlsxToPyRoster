- Remove __getTime from the Shifts.py class
--> This should now already be getting parsed a datetime object

- COLLAPSE METHODS so that they use arrays? e.g.
####################
--> This will allow multiple functions to be used for the same thing.
--> E.g.
- method(name)
--> Can get the desired date for one name, or
- method([array,of,names])
--> Can get the desired date for each period
- method()
--> Can get the desired date for all columns in roster
###################
--> Would be able to remove some duplicate functions that work for all staff/single staff
--> Would then allow all functions to be usable in a batch. e.g. Get shifts for 2/5 of the staff of shift

- Add PUBLIC functions to UPDATE the data
--> Change the Shift for an individual
--> Change a range of shifts for an individual
--> Both of the above for multiple or all staff

- Add functions to OUTPUT modified Python object back to CSV
- Add functions to OUTPUT object into other formats (e.g. Google Calendar CSV formats)

- Break it and add further exception handling
--> Non-existent name parsed (KeyError)
--> Number instead of string, etc.
--> No file found
